9|1|"Cut the onion into slices. Heat a pan on medium with 1 tbsp olive oil. Add the onions and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally so that they don't burn.After 10 minutes, sprinkle with salt and mix."
9|2|"Lower the heat and cook for another 30 minutes, stir every few minutes prevent burning. (If the onions stick to the pan, add a bit of water to help unstick them.) While they're cooking, prepare the rest of the ingredients."
9|3|"Cut your meat into bite size pieces. Peel the potato cut them into large pieces. Try not to cut them too small otherwise they will fall apart during the cooking process. Core and cut bell pepper into strips. Cut asparagus diagonally into 2-inch pieces."
9|4|"Heat a large pot on medium and add 1 tbsp butter and 2 cloves of crushed garlic. Once the butter is melted and the garlic is fragrant, add the meat to the pan and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Brown the outsides to seal in the juices. Add all of the potato to the pot. Cook together for a few minutes.Add the caramelized onion to the pot and stir."
9|5|"Next, pour in water, chicken stock, and black tea and bring it to the boil. Once it's boiling, turn the heat down to medium-low and simmer for 20 mins with the lid slightly ajar. While you're waiting, check back from time to time and use a spoon to skim the foamy residue from the top of the simmering liquid."
9|6|"After 20 mins, turn the heat down to low and add your Japanese curry roux. Mix in the roux and then simmer without the lid for 5-10 minutes. (Stir from time to time to make sure it doesn't get stuck to the bottom of the pan). If it gets too thick, add more water (50ml-100ml at a time). If it's too thin, cook for longer."
9|7|"Heat a drizzle of olive oil in a pan. Saute the asparagus and bell pepper for about 6-7 mins. Season with salt and pepper. Add to the curry and mix. Enjoy!"
36|1|"Finely dice the onion. Slice the Zucchini in half lengthwise and then into 1/4 inch thick pieces. Mince the garlic."
36|2|"Put a pot of water on to boil. In a large skillet over medium-high heat, cook the onions in 3 tablespoons olive oil until softened, 5 to 8 minutes. Reduce heat as necessary to keep onions from browning. Add zucchini,  season generously with salt and pepper, and continue cooking, stirring occasionally until rather soft, about 10 minutes. Turn off heat."
36|3|"Meanwhile, use a mortar and pestle to pound garlic, basil and a little salt into a rough paste (or use a mini food processor). Stir in 3 tablespoons olive oil."
36|4|"Salt the pasta water well and put in the pasta, stirring. Boil per package instructions but make sure to keep pasta quite al dente. Drain pasta, reserving 1 cup of cooking water."
36|5|"Add cooked pasta to zucchini in skillet and turn heat to medium-high. Add 1/2 cup cooking water, then the ricotta, crushed red pepper and lemon zest, stirring to distribute. Check seasoning and adjust. Cook for 1 minute more. Mixture should look creamy. Add a little more pasta water if necessary. Add the basil paste and half the grated cheese and quickly stir to incorporate. Spoon pasta into warm soup plates and sprinkle with additional cheese. Serve immediately."
37|1|"Juice the lemons. Crush and peel the garlic (leave whole)."
37|2|"In a toaster oven or skillet, toast almonds until golden brown and fragrant. Set aside to cool."
37|3|"In a bowl, combine lemon juice and 1 heaping teaspoon salt. Slowly whisk in olive oil. Add garlic cloves and set aside to steep."
37|4|"Working in batches, cut the kale into thin ribbons: gather a large handful of leaves, bunch together tightly, and use the other hand to slice into 1/4-inch-thick pieces. This need not be done very precisely or neatly; the idea is to end up with a kind of slaw. (Recipe can be made up to this point 1 day ahead. Keep kale and dressing refrigerated separately.)"
37|5|"Place chopped kale in a very large bowl. Sprinkle surface with almonds and then with cheese, if using. Remove and discard garlic cloves from dressing. Pour half the dressing over the salad and toss. Taste for dressing and salt and add more as needed, tossing to coat thoroughly. Serve within 1 hour."
