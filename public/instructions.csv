27|1|"Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the honeynut squash cut-side-down on a lined baking sheet and roast for 18-20 minutes or until soft throughout."

Bring this to a simmer for 30-45 minutes or until the porridge is opaque and thickened, stirring occasionally so no rice sticks to the bottom of the pan."
