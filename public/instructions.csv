3|1|"Adjust rack to top position and preheat oven to 425 degrees. Wash and dry all produce. Halve, peel, and cut onion into 1/2-inchthick wedges; mince a few wedges until you have 2 TBSP. Peel and mince or grate garlic. Roughly chop pistachios. Drain and rinse chickpeas; pat very dry with paper towels. Roughly chop cilantro. Zest and quarter lemon. 4 SERVINGS: Adjust racks to top and middle positions. Mince a few onion wedges until you have 4 TBSP."
3|2|"Melt 1 TBSP butter in a small pot over medium-high heat. Add minced onion, half the garlic, half the pistachios (save the rest for serving), half the Shawarma Spice (you’ll use the rest in the next step), and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring, 1 minute. Stir in rice, 3/4 cup water, stock concentrate, and a big pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until rice is tender, 15-18 minutes. Keep covered off heat. 4 SERVINGS: Use 2 TBSP butter, a medium pot, and 1 1/2 cups water."
3|3|"Meanwhile, toss onion wedges, tomatoes, and chickpeas on a baking sheet with a large drizzle of olive oil, remaining Shawarma Spice, pepper, and a few pinches of salt. Roast on top rack, tossing halfway through, until veggies are tender and lightly charred and chickpeas are crispy, 18-20 minutes. 4 SERVINGS: Divide everything between 2 baking sheets; roast on top and middle racks, tossing veggies and swapping rack positions halfway through roasting. TIP: It’s natural for chickpeas to pop a bit."

16|5|"Give the mixture a good stir and bring it to the boil.Reduce the heat then leave to simmer slowly for 35-40 minutes (stirring often to prevent it sticking to the pan) until the most of the liquid has been absorbed by the rice.Remove from the heat and serve hot."

27|1|"Preheat the oven to 400F. Place the honeynut squash cut-side-down on a lined baking sheet and roast for 18-20 minutes or until soft throughout."
27|2|"While the squash is roasting, add the rice, ginger, garlic and four cups of water to a high-sided saute pan. Season with a big pinch of salt. Bring this to a simmer for 30-45 minutes or until the porridge is opaque and thickened, stirring occasionally so no rice sticks to the bottom of the pan."
27|3|"When the honeynut is cool enough to handle, scoop the insides out, mash it up and whisk together with 1 1/2 cups of water. Pour this into the thickened congee mixture, and add the soy sauce and rice vinegar. Adding more to taste as needed."
